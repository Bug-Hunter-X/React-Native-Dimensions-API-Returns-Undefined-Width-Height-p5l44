This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native applications. The problem arises because the `Dimensions` API might return undefined or inaccurate width and height values before the component's layout is fully established.  This can lead to incorrect rendering and potential application crashes.  The solution provided employs the `useEffect` hook along with `Dimensions.addEventListener` to ensure accurate dimension retrieval after the layout is complete.
